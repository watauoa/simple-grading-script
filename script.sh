# This program aims to prog1's grading more quickly. The uniqueness of this program is the partial score interaction and the score outputting.
# 
# Usage:
# 1 Change the below variables appropriately.
# You may have to customize any other part to fit the exercise's problem. 
# About variables, read the explanations below.
# 
# 2 After you run this program, you interact about partial scores.
# Whenever a student's program is executed, you will see a message about the partial score. If you think this program or output deserves to earn the partial score, you can instruct the program to add the partial score by pressing the yes_char key (mention below). If you think this program doesn't deserve it, press any other keys than the yes_char key.
# 
# 3 Input the scores to the spreadsheet by viewing the score file.
# The score file is named like score_ex3_prog01_C3.txt and is in the directory created like ex3_prog01_C3.
# You can input scores more quickly than inputting manually.
# At first, you have to show only scores with this command:
# cat score_ex3_prog01_C3.txt | cut -d, -f2
# Next, you can paste scores in once by copying the whole output of the above command and pasting it with ctrl-v after selecting the most above cell.

# The input string. Inputting enter key should be expressed as \n. Additionally, inputting ctrl-d doesn't have to express in this string.
# If an input is from a file specified by a file name, this string should be the one-line content string that was replaced from newline to \n.
# If an input is command line arguments, you have to modify the part "running the program".
stdinstr="to\nAdvance\nKnowledge\nfor\nHumanity\n"

# Meanings of the file_exist_score and the compilable_score is obvious.
# Those variables are about partial part interaction. 
# The msg is the sentence that will be displayed in the interaction. Those sentences are up to you, so it's OK to write like msg=("1" "2" "3") if you know what the numbers mean.
# The meaning of part_score is obvious. The order of the numbers corresponds to the order of msg.
# The file_to_check is the file paths that should be checked when the score interaction. The keyword "src" and "out" is acceptable. The "src" is the source code file. The "out" is the output texts. If you should check multiple files, those files can be specified by colon separated value.
# The re_str and re_cnt will be used to grade files with regex. If the re_check is empty, this function never work. TODO: more explanation.
